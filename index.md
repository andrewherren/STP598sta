## Welcome to STP 598 SpatioTemporal Analysis

This course focuses on modern techniques in analyzing spatiotemporal data. It consists of two major parts: spatial statistics and time series. The topics will in- clude spatial process, areal data models, hierarchical spatial modeling, time series regression, ARMA/ARIMA models, Gaussian process, and state-space models.

### Announcements:
